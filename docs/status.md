# Status

Last updated at the end of the first session (2026-10-04).

## Working in game (tested by Tyler)

- Search, shift-click and alt-click from bags into Search and Post.
- Buy bar: trade goods by quantity with a confirmed server price, gear one at a time.
  Purchases matched the mail exactly.
- Resizable window that remembers its size and position.
- Rename to auxForever, credit line "aux by shirsig, granted immortality by Tyler".
- New look: top bar with tabs, rounded corners, amber accent, "N sellers" in the seller column.
- Undercut mode: match the cheapest price by default, goblin toggle to undercut.
- Post tab duration dropdown (fixed this session).

## Open

1. Done: Forever rejected all three bundled fonts (Barlow, a basic rebuild, PT Sans Narrow), so
   they were removed and the game font is used. Cancel on the buy bar was fixed (it was hidden
   and re-shown every frame, which drops clicks); needs checking in game.
2. Done: the status bar is dim gray when idle (Tyler agreed). Gear is now priced in whole silver
   and undercut by 1 silver; needs checking in game (post a green item in undercut mode).
3. Parts of the mockup not built yet: "Results N" count, the summary line next to the sub tabs
   ("11 price levels, 6,180 for sale, searched 4s ago"), a search icon in the search box.
   Column names were kept as in aux on purpose.
4. Not yet tested in game: Auctions tab cancel, Bids tab, full scan, posting gear with a bid,
   Filter Builder dropdowns after the dropdown fix. See `TESTING.md`.
5. Later: Tyler sends Simon (shirsig) the project to review before it goes public. The GitHub
   repository can optionally be renamed to auxForever.

## Repository

Public since 2026-10-04. All work is on `claude/modest-volta-4mgmsb` (PR #1); `main` still holds
only the initial commit until Tyler merges, so a download of `main` is not auxForever yet.

## Recent decisions

- Undercut mode starts off every time the auction house opens (Tyler: never remembered).
- Quick searches, the gold finished-search bar and the fading history arrows tested fine in game.

## Post tab facelift (built from the mockup, needs testing in game)

https://claude.ai/artifact/9gx3SMqfU46WMGbZ11iwKv : Match lowest / Undercut switch with the goblin,
a "?" for the undercut hint, bigger price box with a "% of usual" badge, a summary row (items,
total, deposit, "you get" after the 5% cut, Post button), steppers with Max, duration as 2h/8h/24h
buttons, "Hide from this list" next to the item name.

Auction house cut: 5% (Tyler's research; retail value). Keep it one constant. Deposits come from the
game's own CalculateItemDeposit / CalculateCommodityDeposit, not a formula, so a server-side
deposit change shows up by itself. Tyler's notes also claimed a flat 1 silver deposit minimum, but
his own Post tab showed a 1c deposit for Minor Mana Potion, so that claim is not trusted.

## Background opacity (built)

Gear in the top bar, 70% to 100%, only backgrounds fade (gui.register_background). Light mode was
considered and turned down: game item colors are made for dark backgrounds and it doubles UI work.

## Quick searches (built, tested in game)

Clock button next to "<" on the Search tab (tabs/search/quick.lua): pinned searches (aux's
favorites) and recent searches, with icon, cheapest price seen and time. Mockup:

## Ideas Tyler mentioned for later

- Expand undercut mode beyond one step (start simple, iterate).
- Remove the "/aux undercut" explanation once Forever players know the mechanic.
