# Testing auxForever in game

Each test build gets a test page from Claude: one card per step with Pass, Fail and Skip, a note
and screenshots. Answers save by themselves and Claude reads them, so say "done" in the chat when
finished. The steps below are the same as on the page, for anyone testing without it.

If BugSack shows an error at any point, copy its full text into that step's note.

## Current build: 0.7.1 build 2

Tyler (2026-10-17): "all these changes are going to just be .7.1". Build 1 was the same Auctions
tab and search fixes under the name 0.7.0.1 (never tested). Build 2 adds the deposit rounding
(FB-017) and the "Post tab starts on" setting (FB-018). Zip `auxForever-0.7.1-build2.zip`;
`/reload` is enough (no new files). Test page build id `0-7-1-build-2`. Steps, in the New theme:

- [ ] 1. Post 3 of the same item that is not a trade good (gear or bags, for example 3 Linen
      Bags) at the same price, then 1 more at another price. Auctions tab: 4 rows, each with
      Qty 1. None is hidden under another row.
- [ ] 2. Select one of the 3 at the same price and press Cancel. That row says "Cancelling...",
      then "Cancelled, comes by mail", then leaves the list within a few seconds. The other 2
      stay, with their status.
- [ ] 3. Press "Blizzard UI" at the top: Blizzard's Auctions tab shows the same auctions as aux
      (the 3 left from step 2).
- [ ] 4. Search tab: type the full name of a piece of gear you can see in Blizzard's window (not
      a trade good) and search. aux lists as many as Blizzard does. If a chat line says an item
      "could not be read in time", write that in the note and search again.
- [ ] 5. Same item, from the suggestion while typing (it adds `/exact`): the same number again.
- [ ] 6. Paste `/run print(C_AuctionHouse.SupportsCopperValues())` in chat and write down what
      it prints. Then pick 20 Copper Ore (or another cheap trade good) on the Post tab: aux's
      Deposit is the same as Blizzard's Sell window shows for the same amount.
- [ ] 7. Settings (gear), Posting: "Post tab starts on", pick Undercut. Close and reopen the
      auction house: the Post tab is in Undercut mode (goblin). Set it back to Match lowest.
- [ ] 8. Settings, theme Classic, `/reload`, open the Auctions tab: your auctions show, one row
      each.

### 0.7 build 4

FB-013 (HoaxBox, iLvl and colored Req columns) and FB-012 (MDHippie, `AuxForeverAPI`), plus the
fast resize fix. Tested by Tyler on 2026-10-13: all 6 steps pass. Released as 0.7. The steps are
in git history (`TESTING.md` at commit 37336f7).

### 0.6.1.1 build 1

Fix for FB-011 (Gaddor): clicking an item's icon in the Post tab's bag list selects it. Tested by
Tyler on 2026-10-12 (screenshots): all 3 steps pass (icon click selects, name click selects,
right-click on the icon searches). Released as 0.6.1.1.

Earlier: 0.6.1 build 2 (weapon slots in Search, audit fixes), tested in game and released. Its
steps and results, kept for reference:

### 0.6.1 build 2

Tested by Tyler on 2026-10-11 (test page `0-6-1-build-2`, screenshots): steps 1 to 5 pass
(daggers, staves, cloth chests and bows only, In words "Daggers (weapons, one-handed)."). Step 6:
autocompletion works ("linen" completed to "linen bag/exact"); own auctions not checked, he had
none up. Tyler found step 6 confusing (two checks in one, the second needing auctions). Optional
steps 7 and 8 done: the game's names, now in `tests/forever_categories.lua`.

0.6.1 build 1 was the same weapon slot fix under the name 0.6.0.3. `/reload` is enough (no new
files). Steps, in the New theme:

- [ ] 1. Search tab, "Which items": Category Weapons, Type One-Handed, Slot Daggers, then Search.
      The search bar shows `weapons/one-handed/daggers`, the search is short, and only daggers
      are listed.
- [ ] 2. Same with Two-Handed and Staves: only staves.
- [ ] 3. Armor, Cloth, Chest: only cloth chest pieces (this worked before; check it still does).
- [ ] 4. Type `weapons/ranged/bows` in the search bar and press Enter: only bows, and the menus
      show Weapons, Ranged, Bows.
- [ ] 5. Filter Builder tab, after step 1: "In words" reads "Daggers (weapons, one-handed)".
- [ ] 6. After a search, type the first letters of an item from the results in the search bar:
      its name is offered. Your own auctions still show as yours (green) in the Auctions tab.

Optional (checks the category names the automated tests use; `docs/audit-classic-code.md`), with
the auction house open, paste each line into chat and take a screenshot of what it prints:

- [ ] 7. `/run for i,c in ipairs(AuctionCategories) do local t={} for _,s in ipairs(c.subCategories or {}) do t[#t+1]=s.name end print(i,c.name,table.concat(t,", ")) end`
- [ ] 8. `/run for _,s in ipairs(AuctionCategories[1].subCategories) do local t={} for _,x in ipairs(s.subCategories or {}) do t[#t+1]=x.name end print(s.name,table.concat(t,", ")) end`

## Before every release: the 5-minute check

Tyler (2026-10-07): the old 15-minute quick run was too long. This is one walk through the
auction house, about 5 minutes, that touches every tab once. Everything else is covered by the
automated tests (run on every push) and by the build steps of the version, which test whatever
changed.

- [ ] 1. Log in and talk to an auctioneer: aux opens, no BugSack error.
- [ ] 2. Search `linen cloth` and buy 1 with the buy bar (Buy, then Confirm): it is bought.
- [ ] 3. Post tab: post one item at the price aux picks: it says "Posted".
- [ ] 4. Auctions tab: that item is listed with a status.
- [ ] 5. Sniper tab: Start, wait for one round, Stop.
- [ ] 6. Open a profession window: the Materials line shows under a recipe's reagents.

Agents: keep this list at six steps or fewer. Add a step only for something that broke in a
release before, and say which.

## For agents

Add the in-game checks for each change to "Current build" above (and to the build's test page, if
one exists). One thing per step. If a step needs something the tester may not have (auctions
up, a second character, a rare item), say how to set it up or leave the step out (0.6.1 build 2,
step 6: two checks in one, the second needing auctions; Tyler found it confusing). The
pre-release check stays at six steps (Tyler's limit); do not move build steps into it. Older
detailed checklists: `docs/testing-history.md`.
